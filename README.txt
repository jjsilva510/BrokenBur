We use to lose a lot of burs (tool used for milling) and a lot of the times we did not know if it was broken or if my coworkers lost them by accident so I created this quick form that would give ask necessary questions in order to break down where the burs went. I made sure to make it easy to understand and easy to store locally so it would be easy for anyone to find again.

this is a test
